Create a simple Node JSON API server locally, that fetches (gets) data from a local employees.json file, for simplicity purposes.
More complexity could have been added using ejs (for templating and creating various routes) and mongoDB (mongoose) for fetching data from a database. Also, data could have been fetched from an API like GitHub, OpenWeather, etc.
STEPS for creating the app:
* use the code editor of your choice
* install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* create project folder, cd into it and npm init. This generates package.json file by default.
* npm install express and nodemon (to help us restart our server for us); add "start": "nodemon server.js" under "scripts" in the package.json file
* install the pakages with: npm install
* create the app.js file, where we:
- require the packages,
- create the instance of express to handle the json data coming from our local employees.json file (or a database),
- and launch the server (listening on a port of our choice, 3000 in this case)
* create a data file: employees.json that holds the data (in json format) that we want to parse.
* create route and use the GET method to fetch data from the local file
I recommend you install the JSON Viewer Pro extension for Google Chrome to have a prettified view of the JSON data displayed in the browser.
